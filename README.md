# Single File Agents (SFA)
> Premise: What if we could pack single purpose, powerful AI Agents into a single python file?

## What is this?

A collection of powerful single-file agents built on top of [uv](https://github.com/astral/uv) - the modern Python package installer and resolver. These agents aim to do one thing and one thing only. They demonstrate precise prompt engineering and GenAI patterns for practical tasks many of which I share on the [IndyDevDan YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@indydevdan).

## Features

- **Self-contained**: Each agent is a single file with embedded dependencies
- **Minimal, Precise Agents**: Carefully crafted prompts for small agents that can do one thing really well
- **Modern Python**: Built on uv for fast, reliable dependency management
- **Run From The Cloud**: With uv, you can run these scripts from your server or right from a gist (see my gists commands)

## Agents
> Note: We're using the term 'agent' loosely. These SFA's are prompts, prompt chains, and a couple are official Agents.

### JQ Command Agent (sfa_jq_gemini_v1.py)
An AI-powered assistant that generates precise jq commands for JSON processing

Example usage:
```bash
# Generate and execute a jq command
uv run sfa_jq_gemini_v1.py --exe "Filter scores above 80 from data/mock.json and save to high_scores.json"

# Generate command only
uv run sfa_jq_gemini_v1.py "Filter scores above 80 from data/mock.json and save to high_scores.json"
```

- jq command-line JSON processor

### Installing Required Tools

#### jq Installation

macOS:
```bash
brew install jq
```

Windows:
- Download from [stedolan.github.io/jq/download](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)
- Or install with Chocolatey: `choco install jq`

#### DuckDB Installation

macOS:
```bash
brew install duckdb
```

Windows:
- Download the CLI executable from [duckdb.org/docs/installation](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation)
- Add the executable location to your system PATH

## Installation

1. Install uv:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

3. Set your Gemini API key (for JQ generator):
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```
